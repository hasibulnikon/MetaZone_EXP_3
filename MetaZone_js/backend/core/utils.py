    """Confirms a dropped file is actually a complete, readable image
    before the app commits to importing it — but ONLY actually does that
    work for files that could plausibly still be mid-write; an ordinary
    file that's been sitting on disk for a while skips straight through
    with no added cost at all.

    This exists because of a confirmed real bug: dragging an image
    directly from a web browser (rather than from a file already saved
    to disk) can hand the OS drag-and-drop payload a file path before
    the browser has actually finished WRITING that file — browsers that
    support this kind of drag typically do it by writing a temp copy to
    disk on the fly, and that write is not guaranteed to be complete by
    the time the drop event fires. Downloading first and then dragging
    from disk always worked, because a file that's already fully written
    on disk doesn't have this race at all.

    That "already fully written" case is also, by far, the overwhelmingly
    common one — a folder of images that have existed on disk for minutes
    or years, being imported normally. The first version of this check
    ran unconditionally on every single imported file regardless of that,
    which is a confirmed real regression of its own: for a real batch of
    large (e.g. upscaled, tens of megapixels) images that were never at
    any risk of this race at all, doing a multi-hundred-millisecond
    stability poll AND a full Pillow verify() on every one of them,
    sequentially, turned what used to be an instant import into a
    minute-plus wait — benchmarked directly at ~150ms of pure overhead
    per file even on files with no problem whatsoever, which compounds
    fast across a real hundred-plus-file batch.

    The fix: a file's mtime tells us whether it could possibly still be
    mid-write. If it was last modified more than `recency_window_s`
    seconds ago, there is no live write in progress to race against —
    skip straight to an honest "yes, this is fine" with zero extra cost.
    Only a file modified within that recent window (i.e., one that could
    genuinely still be an in-progress browser-drag temp file) gets the
    actual size-stability poll, and even then uses a cheaper open+access
    check rather than a full verify() pass, since the stability poll
    itself is what actually catches the "still being written" case; the
    open check is just confirming Pillow can identify it as an image at
    all, not doing a deep integrity scan.

    new theme — colors are derived once at ui/theme.py's import time
    (see that module), so a genuinely fresh process is what makes a new
    choice actually take effect, not a live-reactive rebuild. Handles
    both running from source (python app.py) and the packaged frozen
    EXE — a frozen build has no Python interpreter to hand a script to,
    so it must re-launch sys.executable directly with no arguments.

    IMPORTANT (frozen/onefile only): the child MUST NOT inherit this
    process's _MEIPASS2 env var. PyInstaller's onefile bootloader sets
    _MEIPASS2 internally once it has extracted itself; if a relaunched
    child inherits that value (subprocess.Popen inherits the full
    environment by default), its bootloader assumes it's already
    extracted and tries to run directly off THIS process's temp folder
    instead of doing its own fresh extraction. That folder disappears
    once this process exits, so the child breaks the moment you relaunch
    a second time in the same session (the first relaunch can appear to
    work purely because the old temp folder hasn't been cleaned up yet).

    Two more failure modes seen specifically on a SECOND relaunch in one
    session (theme changed twice in a row): a 'Failed to remove
    temporary directory' warning from the bootloader, paired with a
    false 'ExifTool missing' status on the freshly-relaunched window.
    Both point at the same underlying race — Windows/antivirus hasn't
    finished releasing its lock on THIS process's _MEIxxxxxx extraction
    folder (which holds exiftool.exe) at the exact moment we vanish and
    the bootloader tries to clean it up, and/or the new child inherited
    a cwd that no longer exists once this process is gone. Neither is
    fully controllable from here, but both are mitigated by: never
    inheriting this process's (soon-to-be-gone) cwd, confirming the
